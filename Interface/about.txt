just like class, ehich contains only abstract method
(collection of abstract method)

--> keyword used--"implements"

-->interface methods by default public ans abstract
--> interface variables are by default public + static + final
--> interface methods must be overriden inside implementing(sub class) classes

client ----- interface ---- developers (100% client dependent)

                only req. note no any implementation


Difference btw interface and abstract 
interface: 
    -- conatins only abstarct methods
    -- supports multiple inheritance
    -- by default abstract methods are public + abstract
    -- ny default abstract varia
    -- when req. known but have no implementaion info.

abstract:
    --  conatins both abstract and non-abstract
    -- doenst support multiple inheritance coz it is class only
    -- no restriction on modifers
    -- when incomplete implementaion known
