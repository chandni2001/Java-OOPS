process of hiding implementation details from the user.
only the set of services provided to the user

adv: security
    enhancement ---> 

implementation: 1) using abstract class (20% -- 80%)
                2) interface (100% developer will do) 

--> abstract keyword for declaration
--> we cant create object for abstract class, create reference variable from sub class
--> may or may not contains abstract method
--> to use abstarct class, we need to inherit it from sub classes 
--> if class conatins partial implementation, use abstarct class

--> used to represent common behaviour of different inheriting classes 
 action same, implementaion diff

--> half minded 
--> abstratc method must be overridden in sub classes otherwise it will also become abstarct class
